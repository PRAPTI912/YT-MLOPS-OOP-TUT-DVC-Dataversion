1. create a git repo and clone it in local 
2. create code.py and add code to it 
3. do git add-commit-push before intializing dvc.
4. pip install dvc
5. now we do " dvc init"(creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. now we do "mkdir s3" (creates a new s3 directory)
7. now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3"
8. next "dvc add data/"
now it will ask to do ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m"stop tracking data"")
bcoz initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for dvc to handle.
9. again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) and then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
10. now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
11. do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data .
12. now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data,check changes via "dvc status"
13.  again --"dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
